# LittleBits + Arduino = Awesomeness

This repository contains code for 2 activities I developed for the [#PrettyCurious hackathons](https://www.edfenergy.com/prettycurious/experiences),
as part of my position at EDF Energy.
They use [LittleBits](http://littlebits.cc/) as the hardware.
The code is using Arduino, but one could build the same thing with Node.JS and [JohnnyFive](http://johnny-five.io/), or even with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)

## Trombone
A trombone that fits in your palm.

## SmartMeter
An Energy meter that talks to me.
